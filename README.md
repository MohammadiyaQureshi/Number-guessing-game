## 🚀 How the Game Works

1. You choose a **maximum number** — the range will be from **0 to your number**.
2. The computer picks a **random number** in that range.
3. You enter guesses one by one.
4. The game responds with:
   - ⬆️ "Too high"
   - ⬇️ "Too low"
   - ✅ "Correct!"
5. When guessed right, it tells you how many tries it took.
